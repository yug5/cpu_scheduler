# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

A web-based simulator that visualizes and compares different CPU scheduling algorithms using Streamlit.

## 🚀 Features

- **First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- Interactive process input
- Visual timeline representation
- Performance metrics comparison
- Real-time algorithm comparison

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpu_scheduler.git
cd cpu_scheduler
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. In the sidebar:
   - Enter the number of processes
   - Input process details (ID, arrival time, burst time)
   - Set the time quantum for Round Robin

3. Click "Run Comparison" to see the results

## 📊 Output

The app provides:
- Visual timeline for each algorithm
- Average waiting and turnaround times
- Comparison summary showing the best algorithm
- Process execution details

## 🎨 Features
